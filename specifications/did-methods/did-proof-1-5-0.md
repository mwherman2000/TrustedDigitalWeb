# Trusted Digital Web (TDW) "DID Object" Decentralized Identifier Method Namespace Specification version 1.5.0 (Web 7.0 Sharded Registry)

## 1. Context

### Purpose

The purpose of a DID Method Namespace Specification is to define the following:
- DID Identifier Syntax and Construction
- DID Identifier Query Operators
- DID Document CRUD Abstract Interface(s)
- DID Method Platform Implementation Guidance

This "DID Object" Decentralized Identifier Method Namespace Specification ("DID Object" DID Method Namespace Specification) 
defines the end-to-end lifecycle of DID Identifiers and DID Documents for "DID Objects", a key feature of the
Fully Decentralized Objects (FDOs) Framework[5][6][V1.2][V1.1], implemented by the Trusted Digital Web (TDW)[1][7][V1.3][V1.4][V1.5]. 

This specification defines the following:
- "DID Object" Identifier Syntax and Construction
- "DID Object" DID Document CRUD Abstract Interface

This specification also provides Platform Implementation Guidance to assist Implementors in creating safe and secure apps, agents, services and platforms
that are compliant with the "DID Object" DID Method Namespace Specification.

### Out-of-Scope

The following topics are out-of-scope:
- Descriptions of any specific design, implementation, deployment or other internal details for any particular software platform that might support the "DID Object" DID Method.

### Intended Audience

The primary audience for this DID Method Namespace Specification is Implementors of apps, agents, and services on 
the Trusted Digital Web (TDW); including but not limited to: 
software architects, data modelers, application developers, services developers, testers, operators, and user experience (UX) specialists. 
In addition, other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity,
verifiable credentials, and secure storage may also be interested in reading this specification.

## 3. Epilogue

>An Internet specification is like steam (or a horse) - if you don't harness it and put it to work, its value is marginalized.
